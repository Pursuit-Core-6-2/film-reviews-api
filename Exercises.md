# Lab: Working on & Improving Unit 2 Assessment

1. If you haven't completely finished your assessment grab a partner and work on finishing with them.
2. If you finished the assessment. Grab a partner that also finished and swap projects. Have a conversation with your partner about the feedback we provided you. 
   1. If the feedback we provided suggests to fix or adjust any of your code your partner will have to do the fix. You will fix your partner's code if we so suggested to them.
   2. If you or your partner are done fixing bugs or addressing the feedback. Build the next feature for your partner. They might have some ideas of their own if not add these features.
    1. Add a button `random` that picks and displays a movie at random
    2. Use this API https://github.com/Pursuit-Core-6-2/film-reviews-api to save the reviews for each movie. Add a reviewer text field to know who reviewed what movie. 

Who is fully done with their assessment? Fully functional MVP?
