### Bonuses
1. Take a look at the next lesson. To learn how to make make network requests with Javascript
Since you previously had build a simple Todos APP with HTML try to connect that app to this
API so that todos you enter in the page are save to the API. Marking a todo as complete or uncompleted
should work.
2. Find the easter egg.
